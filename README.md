# Nile.co - A Frontend E-commerce Showcase

Nile.co is a modern, responsive e-commerce web application built to showcase frontend development skills using React and Vite. It provides a clean, intuitive user interface for browsing products, viewing details, and managing a personal wishlist. The project is styled with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to design.
